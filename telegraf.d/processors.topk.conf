#   ## The plugin assigns each metric a GroupBy tag generated from its name and

#   ## These settings provide a way to know the position of each metric in
#   ## the top k. The 'add_rank_field' setting allows to specify for which
#   ## fields the position is required. If the list is non empty, then a field
#   ## will be added to each and every metric for each string present in this
#   ## setting. This field will contain the ranking of the group that
#   ## the metric belonged to when aggregated over that field.
